# Optimizing-Real-Estate-Investments
Real Estate Investment Tool: Make smarter property investment decisions using historical data and machine learning to predict success probabilities. Aims to maximize returns (Successful: $1M) and minimize risks (Unsuccessful: $3M).


**Project Overview:**
This project is undertaken to to assist the Real Estate team in identifying properties with the highest potential for investment returns while minimizing risks. Historically, we are assuming the approach relied on external consultants and third-party success probability assessments for each property. This project aims to internalize and enhance that capability through data-driven decision making.

**Objective:**
To develop an automated system that predicts the success probability of real estate investments. The tool leverages historical data and machine learning algorithms to provide actionable insights, enabling smarter, faster, and more cost-effective investment decisions.

**Financial Impact:**
- **Successful Property Return:** $1,000,000
- **Unsuccessful Property Cost:** $3,000,000

**Methodology:**
- **Data Collection:** Compile historical investment data and outcomes, enriched with market trends and property characteristics.
- **Model Development:** Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of property investment success.
- **Risk Assessment:** Integrate financial modeling to assess potential returns versus risks, optimizing for maximum profitability.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Scikit-learn for building predictive models.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

**Materials**
- Code: Please find the code file to understand the approach.
- Data 
- Presentation : PPT to undertand the business impact and possible strategies.
